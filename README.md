In the beginning, we started with a dataset containing about 30300 observations and 56. This dataset resulted from merging two separate datasets, of which one was scraped using an API. Throughout this project, we were only able to utilize a small subset of this dataset’s features as many features proved irrelevant after processing. We built a Random Forest and a simple Neural Network to predict the rarity of a Pokemon Card, based on a combination of categorical and numerical variables. The models of our choice — although powerful and simple — were only able to handle a small subset of our features, given the amount of data. Thus, in the future, to tackle such complexity, we aim to work with Ensemble Models. These models would employ a combination of Machine Learning algorithms instead of just one, leading to greater predictive power and generalizability.

There are many different possible routes we wanted our project to extend to. We realized in the time that we were allotted for this project that we would only be able to predict Pokemon Card rarity based on our selected features. In the future, we would like to create models that can accomplish other tasks within the Pokemon Card market space. This includes models that could predict the price of a card or the possible grade a card may receive based on a provided image of said card. We also worked a lot with models focused on classification for this project. Though classification was productive in our case, there is a case that can be made that choosing a different model for finance related data could help improve our accuracies further. However, we were able to build a high accuracy model with classification for the task we aimed for.

We are definitely not the first group of people to ever build a functional machine learning model to predict characteristics of a Pokemon Card. Many researchers and students have created successful models that accurately predict factors such as price and rarity. In fact, research has shown that there are some models that are more accurate at grading cards than trained professionals hired at grading companies. Despite this, the adoption of machine learning in the Pokemon Card market is still something that is heavily debated. Sellers and buyers in the market prefer the opinion of authorized graders over machine learning models that are created by researchers. Even if the grading of a card is more subjective overall with a human due to bias, many individuals still choose to accept the opinion of the elite rather than algorithms trained with statistical data. As a result, machine learning may need more of an introduction to the community as a tool for our benefit. As models become more accurate and further research is done on Pokemon Cards, we believe the legitimacy of machine learning in the market will be extremely beneficial. Therefore, the research we have done serves a purpose greater than just obtaining a grade for the class. It provides a means of objectivity in a market where everyone is trying to prove the worth of their own Pokemon Card collections.
